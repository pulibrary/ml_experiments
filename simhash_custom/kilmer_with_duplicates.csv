Hecker, founder of the Community of Paulist Fathers and of the Catholic Publication Society. At first, it contained mostly selected articles from English and Italian periodicals with brief departments of science, art and books and few original articles. The contribution of original articles increased so greatly that the magazine soon became completely original and the word Eclectic was dropped from its title.; (cont.) The editorial and literary aspects of the magazine were of high quality. Journalist J. R. G. Hassard was a member of the editorial staff, and Father A. F. Hewit was the most frequent contributor of the many Church dignitaries whose work regularly appeared in its pages. One of the magazine's continuous strengths was its high literary quality. Among the distinguished writers who regularly contributed were Agnes Repplier, Louise Imogen Guiney, Alice Meynell, Katharine Tynan, John Gilmary Shea, Aubrey DeVere, Rose H. Lathrop, Joyce Kilmer, Hilaire Belloc, G. K. Chesterton, Padraic Colum, and Theodore Maynard. Though it has been a popular rather than a theological magazine, Catholic World has dealt with educational, social, literary and artistic matters from a Catholic point of view and has supported Church doctrines.
